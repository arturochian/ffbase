Undocumented arguments in documentation object 'ffappend'

Functions with \usage entries need to have the appropriate \alias
entries, and all their arguments documented.
The \usage entries must correspond to syntactically valid R code.
See the chapter ‘Writing R documentation files’ in the ‘Writing R
Extensions’ manual.
S3 methods shown with full name in documentation object 'all.ff':
  ‘all.ff’

The \usage entries for S3 methods should use the \method markup and not
their full name.
