c.ff                    Concatenate 'ff' vectors
chunkify                Chunkify an element-wise function
compact                 Compact a ff vector or ffdf data frame
cut.ff                  Convert Numeric ff vector to factor ff
droplevels.ff           The function 'droplevels' is used to drop
                        unused levels from a 'ff' factor or , more
                        commonly, from factors in a 'ffdf'
droplevels.ffdf         The function 'droplevels' is used to drop
                        unused levels from factors in a 'ffdf'

ffdfappend              append a dataframe to a ffdf
ffdfddply               Performs a split-apply-combine on an ffdf
ffdfsave                Save a ffdf data.frame in directory
ffwhich                 Create an index from a filter statement
                        'ffwhich' creates an 'ff' integer index vector
                        from a filter expression. The resulting vector
                        can be used to index or subset a ffdf or ff
                        vector.
grouprunningcumsum      Groups the input integer vector into several
                        groups if the running cumulative sum increases

sum.ff                  Sum of 'ff' vector Elements
table.ff                table.ff uses the cross-classifying factors to
                        build a contingency table of the counts at each
